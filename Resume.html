  <h3 style="font-size:50px;text-align: center;">Educational background and personal interests</h3>
<p style="font-size:20px;">I am now studying in Ningbo City Vocational and technical college. I like playing video games with my friends in my spare timeI also like to share some interesting things with my classmates, such as delicious or fun thingsï¼ŒMy academic performance is average</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:50px;text-align: center;">There are three courses in my favorite school</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">My favorite course is mathematics, because I think mathematics can exercise people's thinking ability, improve people's wisdom, and solve rare problems, people will get a sense of achievement</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">I also like the Chinese course, because it is a course that can carry the 5000 year old Chinese traditional culture and enrich people's understanding of Chinese culture</p>
 <p style="font-size:20px;">History is also one of my favorite courses, which can let us understand the history of the famous Chinese nation, which is one of the reasons for China's rapid rise, and let the Chinese people understand their own history of national humiliation</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:50px;text-align: center;">Strengths and weaknesses</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">My strong point is that I have this special talent in competition, and I have a special talent for music and a sense of music beyond ordinary people. I also have a very harmonious relationship with my classmates</p>
 <p style="font-size:20px;"> My weakness lies in my weak sports ability and my lack of manual skills, which makes it difficult for me to concentrate</p>
  <h3 style="font-size:50px;text-align: center;">Overcoming weaknesses and taking advantage of strengths</h3>
 <p style="font-size:20px;"> Conduct self-analysis, find their own shortcomings and deficiencies, and consider the way to correct is to turn my weaknesses into strengths and make up for my weaknesses. To achieve results, sometimes we must face it, overcome it and make it no longer an obstacle</p>
  <p style="font-size:20px;">I want to make use of my strengths in these aspects, give full play to my advantages, solve problems, do things in my field and expand my advantages</p>
